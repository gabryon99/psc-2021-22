# Principles for Software Composition Q&A (a.y. 2021/2022)
This repository contains question and answers for "Principles for Software Composition" course at UniPi. During the oral exam, the professor will ask some questions from the document. Be aware that there could be some small typos. These notes are only for reference, and they are not intended to be memorized. Furthermore, the last questions are not done, since they weren't asked at the first exma session.

These notes are written by @Innocenzo Fulginiti and me.
